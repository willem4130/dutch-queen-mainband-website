## 🎯 Important Notes

✅ **Real-time data** shows in 30-60 seconds
✅ **Full reports** take 24-48 hours
✅ **Privacy matters** - respect user privacy, consider cookie consent
✅ **Trends matter more** than absolute numbers

### Never

❌ **Never share your login** - create separate accounts for team members
❌ **Never delete the property** - you'll lose all historical data
❌ **Never disable tracking without backup** - keep old data safe
❌ **Never obsess over daily numbers** - focus on weekly/monthly trends
