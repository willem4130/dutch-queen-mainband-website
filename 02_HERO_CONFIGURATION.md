## Tips for Best Results

### For Text Mode:
- Keep band names short and impactful (1-3 words ideal)
- Use your theme's heading font for consistency
- Test glow effects - sometimes less is more
- Consider your background image contrast

### For Logo Mode:
- Ensure transparent background PNG (no white box around logo)
- Export at 2x size for crisp retina display
- Test on dark AND light backgrounds if using background images
- Optimize file size - large logos slow down page load
- Consider how it looks at different screen sizes

### General:
- Animation should enhance, not distract
- Test on actual mobile devices
- Faster animations (0.8-1.2s) feel more modern
- Subtle effects often work better than dramatic ones
