# Background Videos Placeholder

This directory should contain background videos for different sections.

## Required Files:
- `about-bg-1.mp4` - Background video for About section
- `shows-bg-1.mp4` - Background video for Shows section

## Specifications:
- **Dimensions:** 1920x1080 (Full HD) minimum
- **Format:** MP4 with H.264 codec
- **Duration:** 10-30 seconds (will loop seamlessly)
- **File Size:** Keep under 5MB each for performance
- **Audio:** Silent (no audio track needed)
- **Frame Rate:** 24-30 fps

## Style Guidelines:
- **About Section Video:** Should be atmospheric, moody, or artistic
- **Shows Section Video:** Can be more energetic, performance-focused
- Should work well with dark overlays (50-60% opacity)
- Avoid distracting motion that interferes with text readability
- Consider your band's genre and aesthetic

## Technical Notes:
- Videos will autoplay on loop with muted audio
- Fallback images will be used if video fails to load
- Mobile devices may not autoplay videos to save bandwidth
- Test across different browsers and devices

## Current Status:
🔴 **PLACEHOLDER VIDEOS NEEDED**

Replace this file and add your actual background videos to complete the setup.

## Alternative Approach:
If you don't have background videos, you can:
1. Use static images instead by changing the section background strategy in your configuration
2. Use gradient backgrounds for a simpler aesthetic
3. Commission or create simple animated backgrounds
